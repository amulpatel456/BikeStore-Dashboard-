# BikeStore-Analysis

# Description:-

The goal of this project was to analyze the data of a bike store company by creating a SQL database and connecting it to Excel. The project involved creating a complex SQL query to join multiple datasets, and implementing the query in Excel. The data was then analyzed using pivot tables, charts, and graphs to create a dashboard that provides insights into sales trends based on different regions, time periods, categories, and stores.

# Report:-

The project began with the creation of a SQL database that included multiple tables containing data on customers, products, sales, and stores. The database was designed to allow for easy querying and joining of the different datasets. A complex SQL query was then created to join the necessary tables and retrieve the required data.

Once the SQL query was tested and validated, the data was imported into Excel using Microsoft Query. Pivot tables were created to analyze the data, and charts and graphs were generated to represent the results visually. The Excel dashboard was designed to provide insights into sales trends based on different regions, time periods, categories, and stores. The dashboard was made dynamic using slicers and filters to allow for easy exploration of the data.

To further enhance the visual impact of the dashboard, the data was connected to Tableau. Tableau dashboards were created to represent sales trends based on different regions, time periods, categories, and stores. The Tableau dashboards were designed to be dynamic and provide insights into the data by using interactive visualizations such as bar charts, line graphs, and heat maps.

Overall, the project was successful in providing insights into sales trends for the bike store company. The complex SQL query and pivot tables in Excel, as well as the dynamic and visually impactful Tableau dashboards, helped to provide a comprehensive understanding of the data. The project highlights the importance of data analysis and visualization in making informed business decisions.
